# Frontend Workshop HTML & CSS Template Compilation 

This repository contains the collection of website sections that the participants of 
the STI Ortigas-Cainta 'Association of Computer Engineers: Web Dev Workshop' will utilize. 

All of the components were solely created by Nathan Villamor.
The following components include: 
1. Navigation Bars
2. Website Heroes / Main Page
3. About Us Section

These section serve as a building block for the participants to copy-paste and
combine together in order to create their own unique website. 

The prompt of the workshop challenges the participants to not only copy-paste
but also complete the missing HTML & CSS elements in order to make their 
website holistic.
